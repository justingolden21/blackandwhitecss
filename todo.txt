ideas:
reference for color palette: tailwind colors greys, icons: hero icons
include js and css that include or don't include tailwind/umbrella
modified umbrella with css, val, and others
split into parts (can only get toggle css and js if needed)
maybe no umbrella (also no alpine), vanilla js : ) (remember to update subheading in index.html)

can provide tailwind code to be used with your tailwind, or raw css output to use without tailwind

maybe: autocomplete, dropdown

common js utils for copy text, download text, local storage, random numbers, input validation, etc

could use animate.css

maybe: files for use with umbrella, alpine, tailwind, utils for hero icons and animate.css

add tabs (!!!)
